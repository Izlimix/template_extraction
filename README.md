# template_extraction
A webpage template extraction sketch in python.

Based heavily on the paper http://personales.upv.es/josilga/papers/PSI2015.pdf and their Browser Extension http://personales.upv.es/josilga/retrieval/Web-TemEx/index.html

Note: the above paper focuses heavily on how to algorithmically select suitable pages to load and analyse to efficiently extract a template.
This project currently relies on the user hand-picking such pages.
